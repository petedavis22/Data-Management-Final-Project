# Data-Management-Final-Project

I worked with a group of four to design an integrated data architecture system for Costco. We created three denormalized transactional applications in Oracle SQL Developer. After seeding data, we implemented an ETL process that pulls data from the denormalized transactional applications, then inserts and updates this data into a normalized data warehouse. We produced data lakes by creating views, merging certain tables in the data warehouse. We exported our supply chain management data lake into MongoDB Compass and performed exploratory data analysis to gain an understanding of payment trends and vendor trends. Our presentation to a class of 50 was well received, and we earned a grade of 99.1 on our final project. 

The SQL code is under the file titled 'Final Code'.
